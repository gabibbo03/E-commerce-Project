# E-commerce-Project 
The principal aim of the project is to create an E-commerce website focusing the attention on the server-side of the web application.

# Server-Side 
We want to develop the server-side using a postgres DBMS and the SqlAlchemy python's library to execute the queries.
Another important framework that we want to use is Flask that allows to the client-side to communicate with the server-side.

# Client-Side
We want to create a dummy website to test the features of the back-end.
